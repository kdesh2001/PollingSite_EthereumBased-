Polling website using blockchain technology(ethereum)

This website is being created on ethereum to create and take part in polls.

2. Ganache
3. Metamask chrome extension
4. Truffle
5. http-server

Steps:
1. Enable and login to your metamask extension.
2. Start a local blockchain on Ganache and connect your metamask to this network.
3. Import one of the ganache accounts in metamask.
4. Start a local host in this folder using http-server.
5. Open your local host in chrome.

Challenges faced:
Being absolute beginners to this world of bloackchain and ethereum, this hackathon was going to be a very difficult task indeed.
We started to learn a few things about solidity, web3, etc from the internet. We faced a lot of challenges while integrating our javaScript and contracts.
The syntax for calling functions , getting variable values from the contract in js was challenging. We are still facing issue in extracting the value of an element of a struct which itself is a part of a struct.

Our project is not finished yet. We can successfully create polls right now. Soon we will be able to vote in it too.( We know the vote() implementation but we are waiting to first finish the proper frontend for visualisation.)
